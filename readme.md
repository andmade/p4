#Description
This app will serve as a library for hard copies of movies that can be loaned out to users. It will allow administrator users to manage a database of films that are in their possession. End users will be able to view movie titles that are available along with a description of the movies with registered users able to checkout/place a hold on the titles, recommend movies for purchase, and create “themed” lists of movies to share with other users (e.g., “my favorite superhero films”, “classic films you must watch before you die”, etc).
